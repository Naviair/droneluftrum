# Common
Contains every resuable component in the project. Should by default be used and/or modified when creating new features/solutions, rather than making new components if possible. If not, developer should focus on making a new reusable component for the cause, and place it in this folder.  

## Form items
New form items should be placed in ```./Form```, to make form components easily accesible through ```Form.<formItem>```.
