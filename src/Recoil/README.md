# Recoil
Global state handling for the project.  
For a brief introduction, see the Recoil States section in our [wiki](https://dev.azure.com/NaviairIT/Naviair%20UTM/_wiki/wikis/Naviair-UTM.wiki/411/Recoil-States).  
New states should be put into separate files for the topic in ```./States```, then linked in ```Recoil.tsx``` to make ```Selectors``` and ```Atoms``` easily accessible in the project.
