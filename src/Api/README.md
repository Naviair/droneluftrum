# API
The api directory handles calls to our backend services and third party libraries.

## backendServices.ts 
Contains query methods for our API's. Developer should put methods for new API queries here.

## fetchApi.ts
Contains fetch methods for local and remote endpoints. ```fetchApiLocal``` is used to test out API calls to new backend services, before uploaded to cloud.
